# Nillkin W2 Traveler Bluetooth Speaker manual


## Pairing

To pair speaker with phone:
1. Power on speaker with pressing and holding power button.
2. If LED is blinking, it's ready to pair
3. If LED stays blue, it's paired with other device. Unpair on that device or do factory reset on speaker.

## TWS (True Wireless Stereo)

For TWS you'll need two W2 speakers. One will be master, the other slave.

Master:
- allows Bluetooth connection
- functions during phone call

Slave:
- connected to master using Bluetooth
- not visible as Bluetooth device (until Factory reset)
- will play whatever master plays (but other channel)

To set TWS:
1. Unpair both speakers from devices
2. Turn on both speakers
3. Pick master and press "M" button for 2 seconds. You will hear pairing tone then after few seconds another tone. Master's LED will blink (ready to connect with Bluetooth), Slave's LED will stay blue.
4. Pair master with phone (there is only one speaker visible). Both speakers LED's will stay blue.

## Factory reset

Press "Play/Pause" button for 5 seconds. This cuts off power and does factory reset. It will unpair TWS.
